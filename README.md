# Foundations of Science I
Welcome to Foundations of Science I, part of the Intellectual Foundations Curriculum at UATX.

The goal of this class is to:
1. Introduce students to different viewpoints on paradigms of scientific progress. 
2. Apply core principles of physics to real-world contexts and practical scenarios.
3. Engage with technical lectures delivered by professionals from local Austin companies and organizations.

To achieve point 3, the university will arrange different speakers to be brought to campus for lunch lectures. On days where there is a lunch lecture, there will be no class in the afternoon. 

## Grading
- 15% = reading week essay on scientific paradigms ([assignment link](https://github.com/eliah-o/Foundations-of-Science-I/blob/main/Reading%20Week%20Essay%20Assignment.pdf))
- 30% = technical lecture/reading reflections
- 20% = oral exam in-class practice sessions
- 35% = oral exam (to be scheduled during finals week)

## Required Text
Our primary technical reading will be the Feynman lectures, which are available for free online: 
- [The Feynman Lectures](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/)

Students must acquire 2 of the following texts before reading week. Each student will choose which two books to select:
